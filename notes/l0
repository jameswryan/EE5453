Security Policy vs Enforcement vs Implementation:
    Policy defines what security is; what it means to be secure.
    Example:
        If you are in the classroom, you should be registered for this class.
    Enforcement is _how_ we implement the policy.
    Example:
        James enforcement:
            0. Print ASAP names
            1. Collect names
            2. Check names
        Elijah enforcement: (Assume classrooms are equipped with swipe access, which is connected to ASAP)
            0. Student swipes at door
            1. Door allows/disallows entry
        Ricardo enforcement:
            0. Prof stands at door
            1. Asks for proof of registration
        David enforcement: (Improves James')
            0. Print ASAP names
            1. Collect IDs
            2. Check IDs
        Anindita (Improves Elijah's):
            0. Use fingerprint
            1. Door allows/disallows entry
            
            
        - There are many possible enforcements for the same policy
        - each enforcement will have advantages/disadvantages
        Example:
            James:
                + simple, cheap
                - easy to lie
            Elijah:
                + simple, less trust            
                - tailgating possible, costs more
            Ricardo:
                + easy on prof, stateless
                - easy to fake screenshot, hard on students
            David:
                + harder to fake than James, simple, quick
                - laborious
            Anindita:
                + hard to fake
                - expensive
                
        'Best' depends on what we mean by best.
        
        
        Perfect enforcement (enforcing all and only the policies) isn't feasible, so we typically stop at 'good enough'.
        
        Implementation - Actual deployed system.
        
        A policy can have multiple enforcements.
        An enforcement can satisfy multiple policies.
        An enforcement can have multiple implementations.
        A single implementation can implment multiple enforcements.
