Text notes for EE5453, Intro to Computer and Network Security
Lecture 1


Last time: 
    Security Policy vs Enforcement vs Implementation
                what        how        code
    
    Enforcement <-> Mechanism
    
    Many to Many relationships between each of these.
    
    

Simple computer network:
    
                    ethernet cable
    JPL (NIC)  --------------------- (NIC) BB
    MAC ADDR 0                       MAC 1

    We can send messages from one NIC to another by modulation on the wire.
    We can write programs that talk to the NICs and implement a chat program between BB and JPL.
    
    The cable sits out in the open, so it is a Public Channel.
    
    
    Attacks:
        0. Cut the cable
        1. Read data off of the cable
        2. Modify data on the cable
        3. Jam the channel
    
    
    0 and 3 are attacks against Availability.
    
    1 is an attack against Confidentiality.
    
    2 is an attack against Integrity.
    
    The CIA triangle is a classic paradigm for computer security.
    
    
    
    
    
Crypto Basics:
    Alice and Bob are good guys who want to talk to each other.
    Trudy/Eve/Mallory is the generic intruder.
    
    Cryptology - art and science of making and breaking secret codes
    Cryptography - making secret codes
    Cryptanalysis - breaking secret codes
    Crypto - all of the above (and more!)
