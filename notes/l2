Text notes for EE5453, Intro to Computer and Network Security
Lecture 2


Last time:
    Built pretend computer network
    Discussed desired security properties
    Introduced Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability
    
    Introduced basics of crypto
    
    
Discussed Symmetric & Asymmetric Cryptosystems
Symmetric - same key
Asymmetric - different keys
This class uses Cipher <-> Cryptosystem

Kerckhoff's Principle:
    The entire cryptosystem (except for the key) is available to the attacker.
    

Ceaser Cipher:
    Monoalphabetic substitution cipher, SBOX is alphabet 'shifted' by 3 letters.

Can do similar, using shift amount as key.
Low entropy key, so easy to try all keys. (Exhaustive key search, brute force)

Can also try full substitution cipher (map input letter to random output letter).
Larger key space (>2^88 keys!).
But the map is always the same, so frequency analysis is possible.

Double Transposition cipher:
    Permute plaintext to get ciphertext.
    Key is permutation matrix and which permutations.
    
    
One-Time Pad:
    Plaintext XOR Key = Ciphertext.
    Provably perfectly secure.
    Extremely fragile. (Vulnerable to key reuse, hard to distribute keys.)
