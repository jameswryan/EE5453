Codebook - Book containing outputs of Random Oracle
Encrypt 'hello' by looking up codeword ('19875'), decrypt 19875 by looking up codeword ('hello')


(Some) Types of crypanalysis attacks:
    Ciphertext only attack
    Known Plaintext
    Chosen Plaintext
 

Real-World Crypto:
    Stream vs Block ciphers (bit-by-bit vs chunk encryption)


Stream cipher design:
    Key goes into keystream generator, take one bit from keystream and XOR with plaintext (synchronous stream cipher)
    Can also mix ciphertext into keystream generator (asynchronous stream cipher)
    
    synchronous stream cipher, keystream only depends on key
    asynchronous ||                      depends on key & previous ciphertext bit
    
    
    
Confusion & Diffusion:
    Principles proposed by Claude Shannon

Confusion - Relationship between key and ciphertext should be 'confusing' for an attacker, i.e., complex.
Diffusion - Concerns relationship between ciphertext and plaintext: if one plaintext bit changes, output bit changes with probability 0.5.



Block cipher design:
    One early design came from Horst Feistel, and IBM cryptographer.
    Called Feistel cipher, find diagram on Wikipedia.
    
    Feistel Cipher Encryption:
    Plaintext block P = <L0, R0>, Key=K, F is round function, Ki is ith round key
    0: Split P = L0,R0
    1: For each Round i=1..n
        Li = R(i-1)
        Ri = L(i-1) XOR F(R(i-1), Ki)
        Compute Li,Ri
    2: Ciphertext C = Ln, Rn
    
    Feistel Cipher Decryption:
    0: Split C = Ln,Rn
    1: For each round i=n..1
        R(i-1) = L(i)
        L(i-1) = Ri XOR F(Li, Ki)
    2: Plaintext P = L0,R0
        
        
    This is secure iff F is a 'good' round function
    
    
    
    DES, data encryption standard, was a Feistel Network Block Cipher developed by IBM & secretly, the NSA.
