Last time:
	Basic Symmetric Crypto
	Stream Ciphers vs Block Ciphers
	Feistel Ciphers & DES

DES doesn't have many practical attacks, and there doesn't appear to be a backdoor.


In 1996, NIST setup the AES comptetiion to design the Advanced Encryption Standard.

Rijndael was the winning cipher.


Rijndael:
	Block Cipher
	128-bit block size, 128,192,256 bit keys
	
Other block ciphers:
	IDEA
	Blowfish
	RC6
	TEA


See slide 17 for block cipher notation


block cipher modes of operation:
	Block ciphers work with only a single block.
	But plaintexts usually consist of multiple (n) blocks.

	ECB mode encrypts every block with the same key.
	But, since identical plaintext blocks are encrypted to identical ciphertext blocks, 

	CTR mode encrypts a nonce & counter with the same key, then XORs the output with the plaintext (This is a stream cipher)
	
	CBC mode chains ciphertext blocks together.
		A plaintext block Pi is XORd with ciphertext block C(i-1), then encrypted under key K to get ciphertext block Ci
		C(-1) is the initialization vector. This needs to be random, but doesn't need to be confidential.
		Encryption:
			C(n) = E(P(n) ^ C(n-1), K)
			C(0) = E(P(n) ^ IV, K)
	
		Decryption:
			P(n) = D(C(n), K) ^ C(n-1)
			P(0) = D(C(0), K) ^ IV
		
		If a bit in C(i) is flipped, P(i) will be unrecoverable, *and* _the same bit_ in P(i-1) will flip!
		(This can be exploited to control the decrypted plaintext!)
