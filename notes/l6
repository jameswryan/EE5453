Integrity w/ Symmetric Key Cryptography

One approach for MACs:
	Use CBC mode.
	Send only last block of ciphertext (called Residue) as MAC.
		Last block is dependent on every block of plaintext, so if any piece of plaintext changes residue changes as well.

	This doesn't work if we want to encrypt at the same time, because an attacker can preserve selective ciphertext blocks while modifying others.


We can get both C&I by computing MAC w/CBC and a different key than for confidentiality.
Only the residue for the integrity part is sent.


Public Key Cryptography
Why? - Distributing keys is hard, and requires a secure channel.

History:
	1970 - Ralph Merkle invents PK construction as part of an undergraduate project at UCB.
	1976 - Whitfield Diffie & Martin Hellman publish 'New Directions in Cryptography'.
	1978 - RSA Algorithm
	1982 - Merkle publishes "Secure Communication Over Insecure Channels"
	1985 - Tahar ElGamal proposes Finite Field DH
	1997 - GCHQ declassifies that James Ellis discovered Diffie-Hellmans construction in 1969.
	???? - Malcolm Williamson & Clifford Cocks (GCHQ) had discovered RSA before



PKC works with one-way functions, 
	invertible functions which are:
		'easy' to compute
		but 'hard' to invert
		unless a secret is known, in which case it is easy to invert
