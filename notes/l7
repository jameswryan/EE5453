Basics of Modular Arithmetic

The integers modulo a prime 'p' form a finite field of order 'p'.

Existence of multiplicative inverse iff gcd(a,p) is 1 (a in Z/Zp) <-> a,p are coprime (always if p is prime)


Rings:
	(From Wikipedia)
	A ring is a set R equipped with two binary operations + (addition) and ⋅ (multiplication) satisfying the following three sets of axioms, called the ring axioms
		R is an abelian group under addition, meaning that:
			(a + b) + c = a + (b + c) for all a, b, c in R   (that is, + is associative).
			a + b = b + a for all a, b in R   (that is, + is commutative).
		There is an element 0 in R such that a + 0 = a for all a in R   (that is, 0 is the additive identity).
		For each a in R there exists −a in R such that a + (−a) = 0   (that is, −a is the additive inverse of a).
		R is a monoid under multiplication, meaning that:
			(a ⋅ b) ⋅ c = a ⋅ (b ⋅ c) for all a, b, c in R   (that is, ⋅ is associative).
		There is an element 1 in R such that a ⋅ 1 = a and 1 ⋅ a = a for all a in R   (that is, 1 is the multiplicative identity).
		Multiplication is distributive with respect to addition, meaning that:
			a ⋅ (b + c) = (a ⋅ b) + (a ⋅ c) for all a, b, c in R   (left distributivity).
			(b + c) ⋅ a = (b ⋅ a) + (c ⋅ a) for all a, b, c in R   (right distributivity).
			
	An example of a ring is Z/9Z, the integers modulo 9

Units:
	The units in a ring is the group of ring elements with multiplicative inverses with the group operation being ring multiplication.
	Denoted Z/mZ*
		'*' should be in superscript


	Let p be a prime. 
	Then every nonzero element in the ring Z/pZ has an inverse under multiplication (because Z/pZ is also a field)
	
Fields:
	Fields are rings, but multiplication is commutative and all elements have a multiplicative inverse.
	Example: The integers modulo a prime p, Z/pZ
	We can denote this field as Fp (the finite field of order p)
	The units Z/pZ* are denoted Fp*
	Fields with a finite order (finitely many elements) are called Galois Fields.
	
	
Primitive Root Theorem:
	Let p be a prime
 	There exists an element g of Fp* whose powers generate every element in Fp*
	g is called the primitive root of Fp
	(or) the generator of Fp*, which is a cyclic group

	Example:
 		Consider F11 (the finite field with 11 elements).
		F11 has 2 as a primitive root.
			(verify this yourself!)
		
		
Discrete Log Problem as used in Diffie-Hellman key establishment.
DH uses the DLP on Fp.
DLP:
	Let p be a 'large' prime
	By the primitive root theorem there exists a primitive root g.
	Then, given g^e=a (g raised to some unknown power e), find e.
	'Efficient' algorithms (that run on a classical computer) to find e are not known.
