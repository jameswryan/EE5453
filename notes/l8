Diffie-Hellman

Based on security of Discrete Log Problem over Fp*

DH:
	1. Alice & Bob agree on (public) generator 'g' (mod p)
	2. Alice picks secret 'a' in Fp* (needs to be careful with choice of a)
		2a. Bob similarly picks secret 'b'
	3. Alice computes A === g^a (mod p)
		3.a Bob similarly computes B === g^b (mod p)
	4. Alice & Bob share A & B
	5. Alice computes B^a (mod p) === (g^b)^a (mod p)
		5a. Bob similarly computes A^b (mod p)
	6. A^b === B^a === g^(ab) (mod p). This is a shared secret between Alice & Bob.

Because DLP is hard, g^a reveals ~no information about a, and g^b reveals ~no information about b.
Additionally, there isn't a way to comput g^(ab) from g^a & g^b

Example:
	p = 941, g = 627
	a = 347, A = 390 === 627^347 (mod 941)
	b = 781, B = 691 === 627^781 (mod 941)
	g^(ab) = 470 is shared secret.
	
It is unknown if the security of DH reduces to DLP, but no other public cryptanalysis has been found.

Diffie-Hellman is vulnerable to a MitM attack, where Trudy intercepts all communications.
Trudy can establish seperate shared secrets with Alice & Bob, and Alice & Bob are unaware their communication is relayed through Trudy.
This is an unsolvable problem (in-band!).

It is possible to use Diffie-Hellman to establish an ephermal key if a long-term shared secret is available.
