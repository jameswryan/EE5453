El-Gamal


Public-Key Encryption Scheme based on security of DLP.
Proposed by Taher El-Gamal.

Alice: 
	choose 1 <= a <= p-1
	compute A === g^a (mod p)
	Publish A

Bob:
	wants to send plaintext 'm' to Alice
	select _random_ key 'k'
	computes c1 === g^k (mod p) & c2 === m* A^k (mod p)
	Send c1 & c2 to Alice

Alice:
	compute (c1^a)^-1 * c2 (mod p)
	this is m
