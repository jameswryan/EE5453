Part Two: Access Control

Authentication: Who is trying to access?
- Authenticating Humans to a Machine
- Authenticating Machines to a Machine

Authorization: What are they allowed to access?
- What are they allowed to do to what they can access?
Access control typically refers to Authorization, with Authentication as a seperate problem.
 


Authentication:
How do we authenticate a human to a machine?
- Something you know
	i.e., passwords
- Something you have
	i.e., smartcard
- Something you are
	i.e., biometrics
	
	
Passwords
many different things can be passwords
PIN
SSN
Mother's maiden name
etc...

Passwords are bad (see slide)

Why do we use them?
- cheap 
- convenient 


Keys vs Passwords

keys:
Suppose we have 64 bit key
2^64 possible keys
On average, 2^63 attempts to guesses

Passwords
suppose 8 characters, 256 different characters
256^8 = 2^64 possible passwords
But, people won't choose a password uniformly randomly

Attacks on passwords:
Attacker could:
	- target a particular account
	- target any account on a system
	- target any account on any system
Common attack path
outsider -> normal user -> administrator


How do we store passwords?

Don't store raw passwords!
Store a hash (ideally using a memory-hard password hashing function such as bcrypt or argon2{id})
Don't just store the hash of a password, include a random 'salt' along with it, and hash the salt together with the password (to prevent dictionary attacks).
