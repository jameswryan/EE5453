Today:
	Kerberos - an instantiation of Needham-Schroeder


In an enterprise environment, there are many different services (print, email, compute, file storage) on many different servers.
Kerberos provides a way to automatically authenticate to each service, if a user can authenticate to a central authentication server.

Kerberos is like NS, using symmetric keys, but with timestamps instead of nonces


Kerberos has a KDC with symmetric keys for each user (K_A, K_B, K_C), as well as a KDC key K_KDC known only to the KDC

(see kerberos diagram)

In kerberos, KDC is stateless (doesn't need to store TGT or S_A)

kerberos has 'realms'.
realms are a single KDC with a set of services.

inter-realm authentication can be done by having the KDCs talk to each other.
The KDC Alice talks to


Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP):
How do we prove knowledge of a secret without revealing the secret?
