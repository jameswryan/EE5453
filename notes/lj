Zero-Knowledge Proofs

Fiat-Shamir:
	N = pq
	S Alice's secret
	N & V === S^2 (mod N) public
	
	See 'fiat-shamir.pdf'
	
	If Alice could predict e before computing x, then she would not need to know S.
	
	If Alice knows e=0, then just follow the protocol (y does not depend on S)
	
	If Alice knows e=1, then compute x = r^2 * v^(-1) (mod N) in step (A).
	Then in (C) send y === r (mod N), so Bob computes y^2 === r^2 * v^(-1) * v === r^2 (mod N)
	
	So, Bob requires that Alice commits to a random x === r^2 (mod N)
	
	What are the restrictions on N? What security does that give us for V? What confidence does Bob gain that Alice knows S after each round?
