Last Time:
  TCP/IP
  
(Finally!) SSL/TLS

See ssl.pdf for exchange

Exchange:

Mostly we use TLS to authenticate the server, not to authenticate the client.

'Mutual TLS' can be used to authenticate a client.


Some (older) versions of HTTP use multiple connections. 
TLS can support this via 'Sessions' and 'Connections'

In message (2), Alice sends a session ID.

Then multiple connections can share the same connection.


If a session ID exists, Alice can use the session ID in the first message, and a different nonce R_A'
Then Bob responds with <Session ID, Cipher, R_B'>.
So message (3) becomes (from Bob to Alice) <h(msgs || "SRVR" || K)>
And message (4) is (from Alice to Bob) <h(msgs || "CLNT" || K)>
The pre-master secret 'S' is reused from the previous connection in the session


SSL is implemented as part of HTTP, an Application-layer Protocol.
Typically then, each application using HTTP must also implement SSL.
And so, only the HTTP data is protected by TLS.
What if we wanted to protect the HTTP header, and the TCP header, and the IP header, and the MAC header? 
This is the use case for IPSec, a suite of protocols.


IPSec works between two TCP/IP stacks.

IPSec has two components:
IKE: the Internet Key Exchange is a suite of protocols for mutual authentication & key exchange
ESP|AH: Encapsulating Security Payload or Authentication Header

IKE establishes a shared secret.
ESP provides confidentiality & integrity of IP Packets.
AH provides integrity of IP Packets.

IKE has two phases:

Phase 1: IKE-SA (Security Association)
  Heavier, like SSL Session
  4 key options - Public Key (Original), Public Key (Improved), Digital Signature, Symmetric Key
  Each option can run in 'main' or 'aggressive' modes


Phase 2: IPSec-SA
  Lighter, like SSL Connection
  ESP & AH can each run in either Transport or Tunnel modes
  Host-to-Host 
  Firewall-to-Firewall or Host-to-Firewall
