The Authorization/Access Control Problem
	Once Alice has authenticated to Bob, how does Bob determine what Alice is allowed to access?
	

Some AC Notions:
Users have unique user ids within the system that serve as their representations in the system.
Subjects are programs/processes running on behalf of users on the system.
Objects are resources that need to be protected.
Rights are the types of access users have to objects. (read, write, execute, owner, credit, debit, etc.)

Let U the set of Users, S the set of Subjects, O the set of Objects, & R the set of rights.


Discretionary Access Control (DAC):
"Owners" of resources determine who can access resources.

	Access Control Matrix (ACM):
		A matrix whose rows are S, columns are {S,O}, & elements are Rights a Subject has on an Object or other Subject.
	
	State machine:
		An ACM is the state of access control at one point in time.
		We want to know if we can move from any arbitrary state to any other state. 
		The general problem is undecideable (HRU safety)
	
	ACL:
		break ACM of each state into columns.
		(store rights w/ resources)
	
	Capability List:
		Break ACM of each state into rows.
		(list rights w/ subjects)


Mandatory Access Control (MAC):
The system/operator determines who can access resources.
