	Access Control
	MAC & DAC
	Users, Subjects, Objects, Rights, Policies (Does S have right R on O?)

Today:
	DAC




Mandatory Access Control - System policy determines who can access resources

One type of MAC could be to use a static ACM that does not allow updates.
This is hard to work with.


Bell-Lapadula Model (BCP):

Users: Alice, Bob, Cathy

Files (objects): file1, file2, file3

Users have different clearances {TS, S, C, U}

Files have different classifications {TS, S, C, U}

Clearances & Classifications are ordered in a Domination Lattice:
	TS
	|
	S
	|
	C
	|
	U
(TS >= S >= C >= U)

BCP does _not_ enforce this access model for Users, but does for Subjects.
Malicious Subjects should not be able to change the classification of Objects.

So, Users explicitly choose the clearance of subjects they launch.

Simple Security Property (read):
	Subjects can read an Object if S.clr >= O.cls

The * (Star) Property (write):
	Subjects can write an Object if S.clr <= O.cls
	This is not used in practice, (it's a bad idea!), so usually:
	Subjects can write an Object if S.clr == O.cls

This is a model to solve the Information Flow problem.


Problem:
	Malicious Subjects can collude to declassify information.
	By creating & deleting files of a certain name, a malicious subject can create a covert channel over which to send information.
	
	Bell-Lapadula does not address security of covert channels.
	
Bell Lapadula also does not address security of side channels.

Bell Lapadula can have 'Compartments' (Combinations of clearances & categories)
