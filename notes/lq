GSM: 1982~1986 (Global System for Mobile communications)

In a mobile network: 
	Mobile Devices
	Base Stations
	Home Network (Area Code)
	Visitor Network (roaming)
	Base Station Controller (connects to multiple base stations)
	Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN, Landline, base stations route over PSTN)
	
(See GSM architecture pdf)


GSM problems:
	1. Anonymity - Network observers should not be able to observe IMSI
	2. Authentication - Only certain IMSIs should be allowed access.
	3. Confidentiality - Call data should be confidential
	
GSM non problems:
	1. Integrity - don't care
	2. Authentication - networks do not authenticate to mobile devices
	
	

GSM Auth protocol

1. Mobile -> (visited) BS: IMSI
2. (visited) BS -> (home) BSC: IMSI
	(home) BSC computes xRES = A3(RAND, Ki) {A3 is a hash function}
	Kc = A8(RAND2, Ki) {A8 is a different hash function}
3. (home) BSC -> (visited) BS: <RAND, xRES, Kc>
4. (visited) BS -> mobile: <RAND, Kc>
	mobile computes SRES = A3(RAND, Ki)
5. mobile -> (visited) BS: SRES
	(visited) BS checks SRES =?= xRES
	if yes, authenticated, continue
	if no, not authenticated, stop
6. Communication can be encrypted with Kc

How well does this work?
Anonymity? No, IMSI is transmitted in plaintext over the air
Authentication? Yes in theory, but not really b/c A3 is weak and is broken for collisions
Confidentiality? No, Kc is transmitted in plaintext over the air. Also, encryption is done using the A# series ciphers, which are weak and easily broken.
Additionally, the BS can opt out of encryption. This means that attackers can setup their own BS, and always opt out of encryption.

A Fake BS can also act as a MITM.


Modern mobile communications have improved a bit, but are still not perfect.
